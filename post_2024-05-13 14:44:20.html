<h2>ielts experience</h2><br><p>today i went through the ielts exam for my class, it is a semester ielts exam, the exam was overall fine and i pretty sure i got a higher band than i expected- it was a speaking ielts exam so i didn't have high hopes on it when i don't study anything yet lol, but i sure do pass like others over more than a band 6.0 so maybe i am thinking i got a 6.5 if unlucky only a band 6.0 from the overall score is fine! i also got a boba tea from our tutor last saturday! it was fun and all, also summer vacay almost there for me so more time to focus on my works aka the ultimate college goal~</p>
