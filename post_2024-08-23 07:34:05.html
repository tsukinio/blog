<h2>back.txt</h2><br><p>after a while i am finally back, well mostly people would surprise after i left neocities then back in the end, let just say that my mood went well this time and decided to rebrand my site. i am going for a more minimalist design with strawberry and pink color so you might as well see that coming together xd. i also find red to be a really subtle and cute for my site design!!</p>
