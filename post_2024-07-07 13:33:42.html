<h2>felt uneasy-</h2><blockquote>WARNING: POST IS ABOUT MY MENTAL HEALTH!!</blockquote><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">It is been around 3 years since i got this kind problem, always went to the doctor every 2 months. My thoughts are really overwhelming, but i'm more suspicious of the environment around me that makes me the kind of victim that they really hate, and thought i'm the criminal instead. This only triggered when I'm around strangers that i dont much or in classes that have a lot of students that irdk. I'm still a high school student, i went to classes for education. When i told this problem to my doctor, sis, parents before they thought that I'm crazy and need more courage (that is what I think but i'm not sure). I am scared, rn I'm really calm, when I'm at my house I don't feel scared. I rly need support- it is hard to tell it out loud idk anymore- I'm really scared and worries i had to took different kind of medicines this week and now my dad have to tell my mom to change medicines again.</pre>
